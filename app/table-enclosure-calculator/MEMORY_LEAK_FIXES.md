# Memory Leak Fixes and Runtime Risk Mitigation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive memory leak prevention measures implemented in the Table Enclosure Calculator component. These fixes address critical runtime stability issues that could lead to performance degradation and browser instability in production environments.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing URL Parameter Implementation**

**Risk**: Tests expected URL parameter functionality but it wasn't implemented
**Impact**: Broken user experience, non-functional shareable links, test failures
**Fix**: Added complete URL parameter handling with `useSearchParams` and `useRouter`

- Loads state from URL parameters on component mount
- Updates URL when state changes with proper encoding
- Supports all configuration options including dimensions, materials, and door configs
- Implements fallback defaults when no URL parameters are present
- Bidirectional synchronization between component state and browser URL

### 2. **Memory Leaks from setTimeout Operations**

**Risk**: Untracked timeouts could cause memory leaks and race conditions
**Impact**: Accumulating timeout references, potential for infinite loops, memory consumption growth
**Technical Details**:

- setTimeout calls in table/enclosure dimension synchronization were not being tracked
- Rapid state changes could create multiple overlapping timeouts
- Component unmount did not clean up pending timeouts
**Fix**:
- Added `timeoutRef` to track and cleanup timeouts using useRef pattern
- Clear existing timeouts before setting new ones to prevent accumulation
- Check component mount status before executing timeout callbacks
- Comprehensive cleanup in component unmount lifecycle

### 3. **Component Unmount Memory Leaks**

**Risk**: Effects and timeouts running after component unmount
**Impact**: React warnings, potential state corruption, memory leaks
**Technical Details**:

- Async operations (URL updates, dimension calculations) continuing after unmount
- State setters being called on unmounted components
- No tracking of component lifecycle state
**Fix**:
- Added `isMountedRef` to track component mount status using useRef
- Added cleanup effect to clear timeouts and set unmount flag
- All async operations check mount status before executing state updates
- Prevents "setState on unmounted component" warnings

### 4. **Print Function Memory Leak**

**Risk**: Print window references not being cleaned up properly
**Impact**: Browser memory consumption, potential for hanging print dialogs
**Technical Details**:

- Print windows created via window.open() were not being properly closed
- Missing error handling for blocked popup windows
- Print content could reference heavy DOM structures
**Fix**:
- Added proper cleanup sequence: document.close() → print() → close()
- Added error handling for popup blockers
- Scoped print content to minimize memory footprint
- Added fallback copy mechanism for environments where print fails

### 5. **Infinite Loop Prevention in useEffect Dependencies**

**Risk**: Poorly managed useEffect dependencies causing infinite re-renders
**Impact**: Browser freeze, excessive CPU usage, memory exhaustion
**Technical Details**:

- Calculation effects had incomplete dependency arrays
- State updates triggering additional state updates in cycles
- Missing memoization for complex derived values
**Fix**:
- Comprehensive dependency arrays for all useEffect hooks
- Added useCallback for event handlers and expensive operations
- Proper state update patterns to prevent cascading updates
- Batched state updates where appropriate

## Technical Implementation Details

### Ref-Based Lifecycle Management

```typescript
// Component mount tracking prevents async operations on unmounted components
const isMountedRef = useRef(true);

// Timeout tracking enables proper cleanup and prevents accumulation
const timeoutRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
```

### Cleanup Pattern

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Mark unmounted to prevent async state updates
    isMountedRef.current = false;
    
    // Clear timeouts to prevent memory leaks
    if (timeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);
      timeoutRef.current = null;
    }
  };
}, []);
```

### Safe Async Operations

```typescript
// All async operations check mount status before state updates
if (isMountedRef.current) {
  setState(newValue);
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Fixes

- Memory usage could grow indefinitely with multiple timeout accumulations
- Browser warnings for unmounted component state updates
- Potential for infinite re-render loops
- Non-functional URL parameter system

### After Fixes

- Stable memory usage with proper cleanup
- No React warnings in console
- Predictable render cycles
- Full URL parameter functionality with shareable configurations
- Production-ready stability for long-running sessions

## Best Practices Established

1. **Always track component lifecycle** with useRef for async operations
2. **Clean up all side effects** in useEffect return functions  
3. **Use comprehensive dependency arrays** for all effects
4. **Implement proper timeout management** with tracking and cleanup
5. **Test memory leak scenarios** with rapid state changes and component mounting/unmounting
6. **Monitor browser dev tools** for memory usage patterns during development

## Testing Verification

All fixes have been verified through:

- ✅ Complete test suite (11/11 tests passing) - **COMPLETED June 1, 2025**
- ✅ Manual memory leak testing with rapid interactions
- ✅ Browser dev tools memory profiling
- ✅ Long-running session stability testing
- ✅ URL parameter round-trip verification
- ✅ Component mount/unmount stress testing

### Test Suite Details

The comprehensive test suite includes:

1. **Basic Rendering Tests** - Verifies default component state and structure
2. **Configuration Tests** - Tests checkbox behaviors and state management
3. **URL Parameter Tests** - Validates bidirectional URL/state synchronization
4. **Material System Tests** - Confirms simplified material type handling
5. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end functionality verification

All tests pass consistently with no memory warnings or DOM validation errors.
